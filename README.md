# Light String 

NOTE: This project as of now is in hevy developement and cannot be even considered alpha.

This is a library that aims to bring a fast and low allocation (very little gen0 allocations) strings to .NET by reusing the current string structure where it can and replacing it with more specialized structure where there is absolutly no way to use standard strings
